                    After graduating from the University of Notre Dame with a bachelors in chemical engineering and a masters in entrepreneurship and business development, I moved to Chicago and joined the Health and Benefits Innovation team at <a href="https://www.aon.com/home/index.html">Aon</a>, a premiere risk brokerage firm. I used my process engineering skills honed at the to solve for challenges in the employee benefits space. After moving from Chicago to Minneapolis to be with my wife, I became interested in finding ways to improve lives using digital and food. In researching the job market in the Twin Cities, I joined <a href="https://www.cargill.com/">Cargill</a> in 2018 as an SAP techology architecture contractor with Boom Lab. During that contract, I won Cargill's annual Global IT innovation challenge and earned a full time role on the Apollo team in June 2019. <br> <br> I work for Cargill as a digital analyst at Cargill in Cargill Digital Labs' Apollo team. The Apollo team's mission is to evangelize technology practices and strategies within Cargill to rapidly test hypotheses, research emerging technology and use this information to craft digital businesses for Cargill. <br> <br> I love reviewing what other companies are doing to improve their intrapreneurial development, and I am infatuated with building things.
